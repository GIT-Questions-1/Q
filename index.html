Outline the organization of the duct system in salivary glands, focusing on the roles of intercalated and striated ducts.", a: "The duct system begins with intercalated ducts arising from the acinar lumen and lined by simple squamous or cuboidal cells. These lead to striated ducts, characterized by high cuboidal or columnar cells with basal striations and abundant mitochondria, which reabsorb sodium ions to make saliva hypotonic. The system further includes interlobular ducts, interlobar ducts, and a main duct that transitions its lining as it opens into the oral cavity." }

It serves as an attachment site for muscles. The deep inguinal ring is an opening in the fascia transversalis, located just above the midpoint of the inguinal ligament, and serves as the entry point for structures such as the spermatic cord; it is also an important factor in the formation of inguinal hernias." },

      { q: "1. Describe the formation and division of the rectus sheath.", a: "The rectus sheath is formed by the aponeuroses of the three lateral abdominal wall muscles (external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis). It is divided by two horizontal lines—one at the level of the costal margin and another midway between the umbilicus and the symphysis pubis—resulting in three parts: the upper part (above the costal margin), the middle part (between the two lines), and the lower part (below the midline), where the posterior layer is deficient and represented only by fascia transversalis." },
      { q: "2. Outline the neurovascular supply of the anterior abdominal wall.", a: "The anterior abdominal wall receives nerve supply from the lower five intercostal nerves (T7–T11), the subcostal nerve (T12), and the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves (L1). Its arterial supply above the umbilicus is provided by the superior epigastric, musculophrenic, and lower intercostal arteries, while below the umbilicus, the inferior epigastric and deep circumflex iliac arteries are the main contributors; the lateral abdominal wall receives blood from lumbar arteries." },
      { q: "3. Describe the boundaries and contents of the inguinal canal.", a: "The inguinal canal is a 4-cm oblique passage extending from the deep inguinal ring to the superficial inguinal ring. Its anterior wall is formed by the external oblique aponeurosis (and partly the internal oblique), the posterior wall by the fascia transversalis and conjoint tendon, the roof by the arching fibers of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis, and the floor by the inguinal ligament. In males, it contains the spermatic cord and ilioinguinal nerve; in females, the round ligament of the uterus along with the ilioinguinal nerve." },

Compare the anatomical features of direct and indirect inguinal hernias.", a: "Direct inguinal hernias occur through the inguinal (Hesselbach’s) triangle, medial to the inferior epigastric artery, and typically do not descend into the scrotum. In contrast, indirect inguinal hernias pass through the deep inguinal ring, are lateral to the inferior epigastric artery, travel the full length of the inguinal canal, and often extend into the scrotum." },
      { q: "5. Explain the significance and anatomical features of the superficial and deep inguinal rings.", a: "The superficial inguinal ring is an opening in the aponeurosis of the external oblique, located just above and lateral to the pubic tubercle; its margins contribute to forming the external spermatic fascia. The deep inguinal ring is a rounded opening in the fascia transversalis, situated about ½ inch above the mid-inguinal point, with its margins forming the internal spermatic fascia. These rings delineate the boundaries of the inguinal canal and are key to the passage of the spermatic cord (or round ligament) and the pathogenesis of inguinal hernias." }

Describe the standard pharmacologic regimen for Helicobacter pylori eradication in peptic ulcer disease and provide the rationale behind it.", a: "The standard regimen typically includes a proton pump inhibitor (e.g., omeprazole) combined with antibiotics (amoxicillin plus metronidazole); this approach both reduces acid secretion to improve mucosal healing and directly targets H. pylori to eradicate the infection." },
      { q: "5. How does rebamipide differ from other antiulcer agents like PPIs, and what is its specific role in ulcer therapy?", a: "Unlike PPIs, which directly inhibit acid secretion, rebamipide works by stimulating the production of endogenous prostaglandins in the gastric mucosa, thereby enhancing mucosal protection and accelerating ulcer healing." }

Design a one‑paragraph report of a liver biopsy that demonstrates “interface hepatitis with stage 2 fibrosis,” using appropriate pathology terminology.", a: "“Sections reveal expansion of portal tracts by a moderate chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed predominantly of lymphocytes and plasma cells. There is conspicuous interface hepatitis, with focal hepatocellular necrosis and hepatocyte dropout at the limiting plate. Masson trichrome stain highlights fibrous expansion of portal tracts with delicate septa extending into adjacent lobules (fibrosis stage 2). No definite regenerative nodules or cirrhosis are identified.”" }
